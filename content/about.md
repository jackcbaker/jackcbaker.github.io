I'm a data scientist based in Manchester. This site is a blog about data science and developing. The views expressed are my own.

Before becoming a data scientist, I was a PhD student in statistical machine learning at [STOR-i](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) Centre for Doctoral Training at Lancaster University. I studied Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for large datasets. MCMC is the most popular approach for training Bayesian models, but it does not scale well to large datasets.
