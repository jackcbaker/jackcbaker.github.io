      <description>I came across this issue the other day: I wanted to include a library in a project, but to make it work in my code I would have to edit it. I then needed to write those changes back to the original library, with minimal faff. This post explains the best way I found of doing this.
An obvious solution is to include the whole codebase of the library into your project.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist based in Manchester. This site is a blog about data science and developing. The views expressed are my own.
Before becoming a data scientist, I was a PhD student in statistical machine learning at STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training at Lancaster University. I studied Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for large datasets. MCMC is the most popular approach for training Bayesian models, but it does not scale well to large datasets.</description>
