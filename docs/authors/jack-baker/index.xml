      <description>I came across this issue the other day: I wanted to include a library in a project, but to make it work in my code I would have to edit it. I then needed to write those changes back to the original library, with minimal faff. This post explains the best way I found of doing this.
An obvious solution is to include the whole codebase of the library into your project.</description>
