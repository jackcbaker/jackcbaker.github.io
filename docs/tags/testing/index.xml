      <description>When I started in my first data science job, I thought making a data science tool reusable meant building one big data science tool that solves the original problem at hand and can be reapplied many times. While this is great when it&amp;rsquo;s possible, there&amp;rsquo;s many hurdles: business constraints might be different, the data sources might vary, or the objective might be different. These can often hamper the ability to make reusable tools.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been there - studying model output for hours to check a model is working. There&amp;rsquo;s some better ways than this. For example designing backtests to check a model does better than a baseline. The trouble with these methods is they don&amp;rsquo;t categorically show that a model doing exactly as it is designed to do; they&amp;rsquo;re also not automated, or (as with a backtest) are expensive to run; and sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re harder to design than the model itself!</description>
