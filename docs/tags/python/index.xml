      <description>R markdown is a powerful tool for sharing insights with stakeholders. You can write snippets of R code that generate plots. This can then be compiled to a HTML or pdf file that you can share with non-technical stakeholders.
This is not as straightforward in python. Yes, Jupyter notebooks are a great way of sharing analysis with other developers. But compiling to HTML/pdf, with code snippets removed, that looks nice enough for a non-technical stakeholder, I&amp;rsquo;ve found clunky using Jupyter notebooks.</description>

      <title>How to include libraries in your project while also editing them</title>

      <description>I came across this issue the other day: I wanted to include a library in a project, but to make it work in my code I would have to edit it. I then needed to write those changes back to the original library, with minimal faff. This post explains the best way I found of doing this.
An obvious solution is to include the whole codebase of the library into your project.</description>
