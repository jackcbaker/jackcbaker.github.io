      <title>A python equivalent for R markdown</title>

      <description>R markdown is a powerful tool for sharing insights with stakeholders. You can write snippets of R code that generate plots. This can then be compiled to a HTML or pdf file that you can share with non-technical stakeholders.
This is not as straightforward in python. Yes, Jupyter notebooks are a great way of sharing analysis with other developers. But compiling to HTML/pdf, with code snippets removed, that looks nice enough for a non-technical stakeholder, I&amp;rsquo;ve found clunky using Jupyter notebooks.</description>

      <title>Three ways to speed up developing your data science solutions</title>

      <description>Your customers want results and quickly. This can be stressful as a data scientist: solutions are often experimental and results not guaranteed; you need time to think about the problem.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll share three ways I use to develop data science solutions faster.
I find there are a few time sinks when developing data science solutions: going down a rabbit hole or dead end, productionising, checking your solution actually beats the current business process, and ensuring your code is free of bugs.</description>

      <title>How to move your data science solution into a hands off state</title>

      <description>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve developed a data science solution it&amp;rsquo;s easy to tinker with it indefinitely: running it manually, making small changes to the output, iterating on the model. This is not ideal - once you have a solution you&amp;rsquo;re happy with ideally you should be able to leave it running with minimal input from you, unless something falls over. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re handing over to a support team, or will be supporting the tool yourself, this post gives some tips when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to move your solution into a hands-off state - or putting it into production.</description>

      <title>How to tell your data science pipeline is actually working?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been there - studying model output for hours to check a model is working. There&amp;rsquo;s some better ways than this. For example designing backtests to check a model does better than a baseline. The trouble with these methods is they don&amp;rsquo;t categorically show that a model doing exactly as it is designed to do; they&amp;rsquo;re also not automated, or (as with a backtest) are expensive to run; and sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re harder to design than the model itself!</description>
