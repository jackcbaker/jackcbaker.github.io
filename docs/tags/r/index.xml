      <description>COVID-19 has changed many established patterns. We&amp;rsquo;re all having to adjust to a new normal: how do we get our data science models to adjust as well?
COVID aside, in any regression or classification problem where observations have a time element, old patterns can become stale. For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m often asking myself &amp;ndash; how do I upweight my most recent observations? In this post I explain how to do this.</description>

      <title>A python equivalent for R markdown</title>

      <description>R markdown is a powerful tool for sharing insights with stakeholders. You can write snippets of R code that generate plots. This can then be compiled to a HTML or pdf file that you can share with non-technical stakeholders.
This is not as straightforward in python. Yes, Jupyter notebooks are a great way of sharing analysis with other developers. But compiling to HTML/pdf, with code snippets removed, that looks nice enough for a non-technical stakeholder, I&amp;rsquo;ve found clunky using Jupyter notebooks.</description>
